		<h1>People</h1>
		
			<h2>Language</h2>
			<p>Japanese is the official language. Although spoken Japanese is not closely related to spoken Chinese, the written language (kanji) is related to Chinese characters. Each kanji has at least two "readings," or ways of pronouncing the word; one based on the ancient Chinese pronunciation, and the other based on the Japanese pronunciation. The Japanese also use two phonetic alphabets (hiragana and katakana) simplified from these characters. A third phonetic alphabet (romaji) uses Roman letters. People are losing their ability to write the complex kanji as they rely more on computers. Japanese can be written vertically from right to left, or horizontally from left to right. In 2011, English language instruction became mandatory for elementary school grades five and six; English is also taught in all secondary schools and is often used in business.</p>
			
			<h2>Religion</h2>
			<p>Most Japanese practice a combination of Buddhism and Shinto. Shinto has no recognized founder or central scripture but is based on ancient mythology. It stresses a person's relationship to nature and its many gods. All Japanese emperors are considered literal descendants of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. Shinto was important historically in ordering social values, as illustrated by the Code of the Warrior (Bushido), which stressed honor, courage, politeness, and reserve. Shinto principles of ancestor veneration, ritual purity, and a respect for nature's beauty are all obvious in Japanese culture.</p>	

			<p>Many households continue to integrate aspects of Shinto and Buddhism into their lives. For example, marriages often follow Shinto traditions, and funerals, Buddhist ones. Additionally, butsudan (Buddhist altars used to pay respects to deceased family members) are common in homes, and kamidana (small Shinto shrines) are common in homes as well as some shops. For most, however, this is done more out of respect for social tradition than out of religious conviction. About 2 percent of the population is Christian.</p>
			
			<h2>Clothing</h2>
			<p>Conformity, even in appearance, is a common characteristic of the Japanese. The general rule is to act similar to, or in harmony with, the crowd. For youth this includes wearing the latest fashions (U.S. and European) and colors.</p>

			<p>Businessmen wear suits and ties in public. Businesswomen generally wear pantsuits or blazers with skirts; bare legs are not acceptable, and stockings or knee-high socks are commonly worn.</p>

			<p>Proper dress is necessary for certain occasions. Traditional Japanese clothing, or wafuku, can be worn for social events or special occasions, but it is equally common for people to wear suits and formal dresses. Traditional clothing includes the kimono, a long robe with long sleeves that is wrapped with a special sash (obi). The kimono is worn by women and men, though most commonly by women. The designs in the fabric can be simple or elaborate. The yukata is similar to the kimono; it is made of lighter fabric and worn in summer, particularly to summer festivals and parties.</p>
