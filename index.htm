			<p>Japan is slightly larger than Germany, or just smaller than the U.S. state of Montana. It consists of four main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. These are surrounded by more than four thousand smaller islands. Japan's terrain is largely mountainous, and most large cities are positioned along the coasts. The nation has a few active and many dormant volcanoes. Mount Fuji, located west of Tokyo, on Honshu Island, is Japan's highest point, with an elevation of 12,388 feet (3,776 meters). Mild earthquakes are fairly common, and more destructive earthquakes hit every few years. Volcanic eruptions are also fairly common in Japan.
			</p>

			<p>The nation experiences all four seasons. On Hokkaido and in northern Honshu, winters can be bitterly cold. To the south, a more tropical climate prevails. Otherwise, the climate is temperate with warm, humid summers and mild winters. The western side of the islands is usually colder than the eastern side. Japan is subject to typhoons in August and September.
			</p>
			
			<p>Japan is known historically as the Land of the Rising Sun, as symbolized by its flag. Beginning with Emperor Jimmu in 600 BC (according to legend), Japan has had a line of emperors that continues to the present. From the 12th century until the late 19th century, however, feudal lords (or shoguns) held political control. Japan adopted a policy of strict isolation and remained closed to nearly all foreign trade until 1853, when Matthew Perry of the U.S. Navy sailed into the harbor of Edo (now Tokyo) to demand a treaty. The shoguns lost power in the 1860s, and the emperor again took control.
			</p>

			<p>The current emperor, Akihito, took the throne in 1989. Akihito's father, Hirohito, was emperor from 1926 to 1989. His reign was called Shōwa, which means “enlightened peace,” and the deceased Hirohito is now properly referred to as Emperor Shōwa. Akihito's reign is called Heisei, meaning “achievement of universal peace.” Recently, concern has risen over the future succession of the emperor, as there are few males in the Japanese imperial family.
