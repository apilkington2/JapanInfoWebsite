						<th>Family</th>
						<td>The family is the foundation of Japanese society and is bound together by a strong sense of reputation, obligation, and responsibility. A person's actions reflect on the family, and as people are often called by their family name, they are continually reminded of that. Affection, spending time together, and spousal compatibility are less important than in other cultures. Japanese society's emphasis on work and career greatly affects family life. Employers have rigid expectations as to the amount of time employees devote to their jobs, making it difficult for full-time employees to spend time with their families. Parental leave is difficult to take without jeopardizing a career.</td>

						<th>Housing</th>
						<td>Living situations are usually cramped in cities. Many urban residents live in apartments. Apartments come in a variety of sizes and layouts, but a typical urban apartment has two bedrooms. The main room is a combination living room, dining room, and kitchen. Apartment complexes are made with concrete or wooden exteriors of varying design. Homes are more spacious in suburban and rural settings, where there might be room for a vegetable garden or a Japanese garden (which often features water, small bridges, rocks or stones, and lanterns) with well-manicured trees. A small plot of land can produce a good deal of rice, so flat land is quite valuable. Rural homes are usually made of wood with tiled roofs and are painted white. They generally consist of an open kitchen and dining area, which is divided from bedrooms and guest rooms by fusuma (sliding paper doors). Older rural homes often feature a glass-enclosed veranda, which functions as a sunroom.</td>

						<th>Dating and Marriage</th>
						<td>Some Japanese youth begin dating around age 15, though most have little free time or spending money at that age. In college, people have more time and opportunity to date. Couples meet through school, clubs, and friends who set up gokon. A gokon is a group blind date in which a couple invites a small group of their friends to a restaurant for drinks and to get to know one another. Most couples avoid public displays of affection.A wedding is a serious event that celebrates the joining of two families. A yuino (engagement ceremony) involving the couple's parents occurs after the groom has asked the bride to marry him. The groom and his parents visit the bride and her parents at her home or a restaurant. According to tradition, the groom's family offers yuinomon (gifts that are decorated with origami turtles and cranes, symbols of eternity and long life) to the bride's family. Yuinohin is money traditionally offered to the bride's family during the yuino. While some families follow these traditions, more commonly the families share a meal to get to know each other and decide on the details of the wedding.</td>

						<th>Diet</th>
						<td>The Japanese diet consists largely of rice, fresh vegetables, seafood, fruit, and small portions of meat. Most dishes use soy sauce, fish broth, or sweet sake (alcohol made from fermented rice). Rice and tea are part of almost every meal. Western food (such as U.S. fast food) is increasingly popular, especially among the youth. Popular Japanese foods include miso (bean paste) soup, noodles (ramen egg noodles, udon wheat noodles, and soba buckwheat noodles), curry and rice, sashimi (uncooked fish), tofu, and pork. Sushi is made usually with a combination of fish (cooked or raw) and lightly vinegared rice. Sometimes a vegetable, such as cucumber, or an egg roll is added to the dish or used instead of fish. Sushi wrapped in dried seaweed (nori) is called norimaki. While sushi can be bought at kaiten sushi bars (restaurants that serve sushi from a conveyor belt) for as little as one U.S. dollar, good quality sushi and sashimi is expensive and usually reserved for special occasions.</td>

						<th>Recreation</th>
						<td>During their leisure time, people enjoy television, karaoke, movies, video games, and nature outings. Employees with intense jobs might use their leisure to time catch up on sleep or spend time with family. Many enjoy reading books, comics, and magazines; simply standing and reading magazines at the store is a popular pastime. Cities usually have community education centers where classes are offered, and elderly people in particular enjoy pursuing artistic hobbies such as ceramics, woodblock print making, painting, calligraphy, flower arranging, and traditional Japanese dance. Some activities vary according to the season. In the spring, people enjoy picnics under the cherry blossoms in public parks. In the summer, there are large firework displays and festivals. In the fall, people often visit parks to see the leaves changing colors. Winter activities include skiing and snowboarding and regional festivals. During the winter, some schools flood the soccer field to turn it into a skating rink.</td>

						<th>Holidays</th>
						<td>Japan's three major holiday seasons are the New Year, Golden Week, and the Obon festival. Golden Week (29 April–5 May) combines the holidays of Shōwa Day (29 April, honoring Emperor Hirohito), Constitution Day (3 May), Greenery Day (4 May, celebrating nature's beauty), and Children's Day (5 May). Aside from these three major holiday seasons, many national holidays are relatively modern and hold little significance for the average Japanese, besides providing a welcome day off from school or work. For example, few people celebrate Maritime Day or Respect for the Aged Day.</td>
