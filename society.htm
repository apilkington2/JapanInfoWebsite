		<h2 id="government">Government</h2>
		
			<h3>Structure</h3>
				
				<p>Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary government. Emperor Akihito is head of state but has no governing power, though the emperor is deeply respected by the Japanese people. The monarchy is hereditary. Traditionally, the emperor's line was allowed to pass only through men, but in recent years, there have been discussions about amending the succession laws to include women, because the number of men in line for the throne has drastically decreased. The prime minister is head of government. The legislature designates the prime minister, who is usually the leader of the majority party there.</p>

				<p>Japan's legislature, called the Diet, consists of a 242-seat House of Councilors (the upper house) and a 475-seat House of Representatives (the lower house). Councilors are elected to six-year terms; representatives are elected to four-year terms. The Diet is filled through a combination of majoritarian and proportional representation elections. More than one hundred seats in the Diet are held by second or third generations of a family, as voter loyalty to local political families is often stronger than a desire for qualified candidates.</p>

			<h3>Political Landscape</h3>
				
				<p>Several political parties are active in Japan, though the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has maintained firm power in Japanese politics for all but a few years since the end of World War II. The LDP's current major rival is the center-left Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). The DPJ was formed in 1998 with the merging of several other parties.</p>

				<p>Party ideologies in Japan are sometimes not very well defined, which means that individuals within a party may share quite different views on how to address important issues in Japanese politics. These issues include the status of Japan's nuclear energy program following the Fukushima disaster; years of slow economic growth; Japan's aging population and low birth rate; and differing interpretations of Article 9 of Japan's constitution, which prohibits Japan from engaging in war.</p>

				<p>A major political dynamic of Japanese politics is known as the "iron triangle," which describes the relationship between the Diet (practically speaking, the LDP), the government bureaucracy, and Japan's business conglomerates. Close relationships among these three groups have allowed Japan to become an economic superpower but have also contributed to corruption and a lack of transparency.</p>	

			<h3>Government and the People</h3>
		
				<p>Japan's constitution protects a variety of freedoms and prohibits many forms of discrimination. The government generally respects constitutional freedoms and combats unconstitutional discrimination. The government is able to provide a range of goods and services to its citizens. Corruption surrounding the relationship between big business and the government in Japan has historically been a problem, though recent efforts have been made to reduce corruption. Elections are generally free, fair, and transparent. In recent years, voter turnout has ranged between 50 and 60 percent. The voting age is 18.</p>
		
		<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
			
			<p>Japan has one of the world's largest economies even though it has few natural resources and imports most raw materials. Also, because only about 11 percent of the land is suitable for cultivation, Japan imports nearly half of its food supply. Major local crops include rice, sugar, vegetables, tea, and fruit. Japan is a leading supplier of fish. Nearly all exports are manufactured items, including automobiles, electronic equipment, and televisions. Major industries include machinery, metals, engineering, electronics, textiles, and chemicals. The United States is Japan's biggest trading partner. An economic downturn of the 1990s badly damaged the economy, which has remained largely stagnant ever since. The 2008 global economic crisis led to a sharp decline in world demand for Japan's exports, a factor in pushing the economy into recession. Local and international economic markets were also damaged as a result of the massive earthquake in early 2011. Despite eventual economic growth after the earthquake, the economy again fell into recession in November 2014. The currency is the yen (JPY).</p>
		
		<h2 id="transportation">Transportation and Communications</h2>
			
			<p>A highly developed, efficient mass-transit system of trains and buses is the principal mode of transportation in urban areas. Bullet trains (Shinkansen) provide rapid transportation between major cities. Subways are also available. Many people have private cars. Traffic is often heavy in large cities. Japan has five international airports.</p>

			<p>Its communications system is modern and well developed. Most people have cellular phones and are regular internet users. Newspapers and magazines are widely read. The press is generally free of direct government interference, though close relationships between media, government, and business sometimes lead to self-censorship.</p>
		
		<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
		
			<h3>Structure and Access</h3>
				
				<p>Education is highly valued in Japanese society. Students are expected to try their hardest in school and take academics seriously. Primary school begins at age six and lasts six years. At age 12, students enter junior high school, which lasts three years. High school, also three years long, follows. Education is compulsory and free in public schools from ages six to fifteen. After age 15, students must pay tuition to continue their studies in high school. Parents must cover expenses such as uniforms, textbooks, school trips, and, if necessary, fees for private juku (cram schools, which focus on making sure individual students perform at their expected level while preparing them for difficult secondary school entrance exams).</p>

				<p>Most children attend three years of day care (hoikuen) before they enter the official school system. Because education is such a large part of childhood, beginning kindergarten (yochien) is a big step in a child’s life. Kindergarten students walk to school by themselves and are expected to be responsible for their behavior at school. Once children have entered school, they are expected to be prepared and prompt.</p>

				<p>Almost all children go to public schools. Some private schools focus on teaching students who did not perform well on standardized tests. Other students attend prestigious private schools, provided they pass difficult entrance exams (even at the kindergarten level). Some prestigious public or private high schools are "attached" to competitive universities, which gives graduates from these schools an advantage during the application process (for example, by allowing them to bypass standard entrance exams) and can aid in finding a job in the future.</p>

			<h3>School Life</h3>

				<p>The public school curriculum is set at the national level and is generally uniform across the country. This uniformity can lead to inflexibility, preventing teachers from adjusting their teaching for students with different learning styles. In elementary school, much of the focus is on learning the difficult reading and writing system. At all levels, the curriculum stresses math and sciences and places heavy emphasis on standardized testing. Students must pass an exam in order to enter a public high school. Those students who do not pass usually enter a private high school instead. Parents often enroll their children in juku schools (which hold lessons after regular schools hours and on weekends) to help them prepare for these tests. While technically it is legal to enter the work force at the end of junior high school, it is virtually impossible to find a job, so the majority of students attend senior high school.</p>

				<p>In junior high, students spend much of their time at school participating in clubs and activities intended to foster group spirit. It is not unusual for students to practice sports or attend activities before school, on the weekend, and in the evenings. Elementary schools do not have clubs and a student's extracurricular time during high school is dedicated to preparing for entrance exams, so junior high is the time when life-long friends are made.</p>

			<h3>Higher Education</h3>

				<p>University entrance exams are rigorous, and competition among students is intense. Students study for years and cram for months to take them. Getting into the most prestigious schools is more important than one's ultimate performance at that school. Once a student passes the right tests and enters a junior technical college (resulting in an associate-level degree) or university (a bachelor's and advanced degree–issuing institution), the academic expectations are less strenuous. Graduation from the nation's top universities usually guarantees students well-paying jobs.</p>
				
		<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
		
			<p>The Japanese enjoy one of the highest standards of health in the world, with a very low infant mortality rate and a high life expectancy rate. Medical facilities are very good. Companies are generally responsible for providing insurance benefits to employees and their families. In addition to a yearly physical offered by the employer, cities provide screening exams for people based on their age and gender. A government health insurance plan exists for the self-employed and unemployed. Pollution in urban centers ranks among the nation's major health concerns.</p>
